=============================
 Updating ETRACS Docker Repo 
=============================

THIS UPDATE will only remove the old Vehicle plugin 
since the new plugin called VRS has already been installed.


Keywords: 

   <User>       - User name of your ubuntu server 
   <ServerIP>   - IP address of your ubuntu server



Open "Git Bash" terminal and login to the server via SSH

$  ssh lguligao@192.168.2.202
    
    p@ssw0rd

01. Pull updates from GitHub

    $  cd ~/docker
    
    $  git reset --hard
    
    $  git pull


    NOTE: Credentials to be used in pulling updates 

          User: etracslgurepo
          Pass: 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



Now the "docker" repo folder is fully updated.
We will now restart the affected containers only.

But first inform everyone to close their ETRACS client 
in preparation for the upgrade procedure. 

Wait until they confirmed.



02. Restart the download container 

    $  cd ~/docker/bin
    
    $  sh restart-download.sh


    NOTE: You may press CTRL + C 
          when you see colored text messages 
          in the console log to exit from the 
          blocking processed.


03. Restart the etracs container 

    $  cd ~/docker/bin
    
    $  sh restart-etracs.sh


    NOTE: You may press CTRL + C 
          when you see colored text messages 
          in the console log to exit from the 
          blocking processed.


04. Monitor the status and logs via Portainer
    especially the "etracs-server" container


05. Inform everyone that they can now 
    open the ETRACS client and login


DONE!
