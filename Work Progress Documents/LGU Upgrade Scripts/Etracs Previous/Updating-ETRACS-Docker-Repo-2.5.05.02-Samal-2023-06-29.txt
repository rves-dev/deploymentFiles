    $  cd
    
    $  mv docker-new  docker


07. On your Windows PC, open the Samba shared folder of the docker machine
    and mount it to drive Z, but be sure to uncheck or disable the option 
    "Reconnect"

08. Open Navicat and login to the NEW database server

    09.04  Press CTRL + R for each file 
           to execute and apply the updates.

    09.05  Repeat Step-09.01 until all files are executed.

    
    Proceed to the next step if all scripts 
    are successfully executed.

11. Run the containers

    $  cd ~/docker/bin
    
    $  sh start.sh
