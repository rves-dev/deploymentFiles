=============================================


Keywords: 

   <User>       - User name of your ubuntu server 
   <ServerIP>   - IP address of your ubuntu server


Open "Git Bash" terminal and login to the server via SSH

$  ssh etracsduero@192.168.254.100
    
    p@ssw0rd


01. Duplicate the docker folder 

    $  cd 
    
    $  cp  -rvfp  docker  docker-new 


02. Pull updates from GitHub

    $  cd ~/docker-new
    
    $  git reset --hard
    
    $  git pull


    NOTE: Credentials to be used in pulling updates 

          User: etracslgurepo
          Pass: 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


03. Pull updates from DockerHub

    $  cd ~/docker-new/bin
    
    $  sh update-docker-images.sh


04. Create the additional custom files and folders

    $  cd ~/docker-new/_custom

    $  mkdir -p mail

    $  touch mail/primary.conf
    
    $  touch mail/bpls.conf

    $  mkdir -p report-files/enterprise
    
    $  mkdir -p report-files/epayment



Now the "docker-new" repo folder is fully updated.
We will now switched the new folder as the main folder.

But first inform everyone to close their ETRACS client 
in preparation for the upgrade procedure. 

Wait until they confirmed.


05. Stop all containers from the old docker 

    $  cd ~/docker/bin
    
    $  sh stop-gdx.sh
    
    $  sh stop.sh


06. Rename the old docker according to your preferred name 

    $  cd
    
    $  mv docker  docker-old-2023-07-03


07. Rename the new docker folder as the official "docker"

    $  cd
    
    $  mv docker-new  docker


08. On your Windows PC, open the Samba shared folder of the docker machine
    and mount it to drive Z, but be sure to uncheck or disable the option 
    "Reconnect"


09. Open Navicat and login to the database server


10. Open a "New Query" window and do the following:

    10.01  Press CTRL + O to show the open dialog
    
    10.02  Go to folder "Z:/docker/_res/_upgrade"
    
    10.03  Open files sequentially starting from 01  
    
    10.04  Select the etracs main database first 

    10.05  Press CTRL + R for each file 
           to execute and apply the updates.

    10.06  Repeat Step-10.01 until all files are executed.

    
    Proceed to the next step if all scripts 
    are successfully executed.


11. Switch back to your Git Bash session

12. Run the containers

    $  cd ~/docker/bin
    
    $  sh start.sh


13. Run GDX container

    $  sh restart-gdx.sh


    NOTE: You may press CTRL + C 
          when you see colored text messages 
          in the console log to exit from the 
          blocking processed.


14. Monitor the status and logs via Portainer
    especially the "etracs-server" container


15. Inform everyone that they can now 
    open the ETRACS client and login


DONE!
