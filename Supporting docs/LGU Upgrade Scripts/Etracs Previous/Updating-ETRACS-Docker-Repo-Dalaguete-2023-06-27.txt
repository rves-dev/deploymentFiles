===================================
 Updating ETRACS Docker Repository
===================================

THIS UPDATE involves bug fixing on 
voiding of Business Payment Receipt with 
Business Permit already issued to it.


Keywords: 

   <User>       - User name of your ubuntu server 

   <ServerIP>   - IP address of your ubuntu server



Open "Git Bash" terminal and login to the server via SSH

$  ssh <User>@<ServerIP>



01. Backup the current "docker" folder 

    $  cd 
    
    $  cp  -rvfp  docker  docker-old-2023-06-27 


02. Pull updates from GitHub

    $  cd ~/docker
    
    $  git reset --hard
    
    $  git pull


    NOTE: Credentials to be used in pulling updates 

          User: etracslgurepo
          Pass: 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


Now the "docker" repo folder is fully updated,
We will now restart the affected docker containers.

But first inform everyone to close their ETRACS client 
in preparation for the upgrade procedure. 

Wait until they confirmed!


03. Stop the affected container

    $  cd ~/docker/bin
    
    $  sh stop-etracs.sh


04. Restart the affected container

    $  cd ~/docker/bin
    
    $  sh restart-etracs.sh


    NOTE: You may press CTRL + C 
          when you see colored text messages 
          in the console log to exit from the 
          blocking processed.


05. Monitor the status and logs via Portainer
    especially the "etracs-server" container


06. Inform everyone that they can now open 
    the ETRACS client and login.


07. Inform their IT to try to void a Business Payment Receipt


DONE !!!
